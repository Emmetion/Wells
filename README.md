# Wells

My idea for this project is to create something that players interact with regularly.
Wells could provide a variety of gameplay mechanics in every players town. 
For example, throwing coins into the well could reward the player with special items, luck, or buffs/keys.
Maybe the well only fetches water 3 times a day, and when you collect the water from the well it's a special brewing ingrediant.



I think this is a decent gameplay mechanic that involves action from the player, and something non-vanilla plus unique.
