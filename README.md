## Feature Breakdown

Here I will describe all currently implemented, and planned features for Wells.


### Creatures
- Creatures have properties that allow them to be bound to a well.

### Town related quests.
- One great feature of this plugin is the introduction to quests in proximity of town-members, making them more engaged.
- Every 3 or so in-game days, a NPC will show up near a safe location at your saved well.
- These quests can be coded with the Quests plugin provided in spigot, and then ported over
- Quests operate in a group-manor, milestones are reached with shared XP.
